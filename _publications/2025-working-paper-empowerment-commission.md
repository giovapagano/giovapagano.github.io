We develop legislative games of empowerment to demonstrate that a supranational alliance between the European Commission and the European Parliament is at the core of the conferral of policy authority to the EU executive. Levearging a machine-annotated corpus of EU directives and regulations from 1958 to 2019, we show that parliamentary involvement and ideological proximity are key drivers of this process, with important implications for EU legitimacy.
