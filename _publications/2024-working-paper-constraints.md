We advance a computational approach to identify and measure delegation and executive constraints in European Union legislative texts, combining a rule-based with domain-specific linguistic features.We advance a computational approach to identify and measure delegation and executive constraints in European Union legislative texts, combining rule-based logic with natural language processing techniques, including named entity recognition.
