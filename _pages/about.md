I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the University of Milan, working on the project *VIPoP — The Visual Politics of Populism* (PRIN 2023–2025). My research focuses on how parties and leaders strategically use visual and textual communication in response to varying incentives. I also apply computational tools to study legislative politics in the European Union, developing scalable methods to measure how laws structure executive discretion.

Beyond these core areas, I use computational text analysis to explore media narratives, democratic rhetoric, and gender dynamics in political speech.

Before my current position, I was a postdoc in the DAPs&CO program on computational methods for political science, and completed my PhD at [NASP](https://www.nasp.eu/training/phd-programmes/pols.html), where I studied online campaigning and affective polarization during the 2019 European Parliament elections.
