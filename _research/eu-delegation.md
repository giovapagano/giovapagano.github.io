title: "EU Legislative Texts: Constraints and Delegation"
image: "/images/research/eu_laws.png"
excerpt: "This research investigates how legislative texts can be systematically mined to shed light on legislative-executive relations, focusing on patterns of delegation and constraint that structure the chain of authority from voters to bureaucrats. By analyzing legislative texts, we provide new insights into how legislators confer powers on executive actors and impose limits on their actionsâ€”revealing the formal architecture of political authority embedded in EU legislation."
